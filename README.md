<h1>Nice to meet you! 🤝</h1>
<p>My name is Evan and my fingers currently feel like falling off because I just played my guitar for like 3 hours before deciding
   to type this 😅. Anyways, less on the topic of bad ideas, I'm currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at UCLA. I am incredibly passionate 
   about being able to help people in a indirect, yet impactful way through the code I write. As a result, I'm extremely explorative when it comes 
   and often find myself dabbling in new languages and interfaces to expand my technical repertoire. Even if my projects end up targeting an 
   extraordinarily niche audience, I'm beyond thrilled to know I'm capable of helping at least one person through their day.
 
<h1>Hobbies 🧳</h1>
<ul>
  <li>🎵 Avid Musician - Saxophonist in @goingoutsideband (on Instagram - shameless plug yes I know) </li>
  <li>🏋🎾 Weightlifting Athlete - I love chasing numbers in the gym and tennis balls on the court (I don't suck, I promise)</li>
  <li>👖🛋 Wardrobe/Amateur Interior Designer - I have an eccentric passion for aesthetics i.e. color-blocking clothes and visually pleasing furniture 
    placement (I don't have OCD...I think).</li>
</ul>
